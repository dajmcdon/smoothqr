The goal of smoothqr is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of smoothqr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dajmcdon/smoothqr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(smoothqr)
x <- -999:999 / 1000 * 2 * pi
y <- sin(x) + rnorm(length(x), sd = .1)
train_y <- y[x < 4]
YX <- lagmat(y, c(-30:-1, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30))
Y <- YX[ ,1:30]
X <- YX[ ,31:37]
out <- smooth_rq(X, Y, tau = c(.2, .5, .8), degree = 5L, aheads = 30:1)
p <- predict(out, newdata = X[max(which(complete.cases(X))), , drop = FALSE])
plot(x, y, pch = 16, col = "lightgrey")
curve(sin(x), -2*pi, 2*pi, add = TRUE)
abline(v = 4)
pp <- dplyr::bind_rows(lapply(p, as.data.frame), .id = "ahead")
points(30:1 * dx + 4, ppp$`tau = 0.5`, col = 2)

plot(30:1 * dx, ppp$`tau = 0.5`)
lines(30:1 * dx, ppp$`tau = 0.2`)
lines(30:1 * dx, ppp$`tau = 0.8`)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
